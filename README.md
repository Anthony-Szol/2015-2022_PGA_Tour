# Introduction

In honor of the upcoming 2024 Master's Tournament in Augusta, this project was a 
short recap of all the players who has qualified from 2015-2022, the most cuts made, 
and Tiger's final score of his 2019 victory (Have to make a special query for the GOAT).

Check out the queries at [pga_tour_stats]

# Findings

With over 200 distinct qualifiers of the Master's, only 17 players made the cut every year. 

# Achievements

These were fun and simple queries but gave me an opportunity to practice creating queries quickly.
I completed these three and the SQL upload in less than 2 hours.
